Hi, I'm Jim, a web developer living in sunny Germany.

![James Hibbard](https://hibbard.eu/jim.jpg)


Currently I'm employed as an editor for SitePoint, where I am responsible for commissioning and editing web-related content for [their blog](https://www.sitepoint.com/blog/). I have also served as technical editor for several SitePoint books, such as [Learn to Code with JavaScript](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/learn-to-code-with-javascript/) and [Jump Start Web Performance](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/jump-start-web-performance)

In addition to this, I work as a network admin and freelance web developer, where I spend a fair bit of my time working on Rails apps.

Here are some of the places you can find me online:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/jameshibbard)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1136887/james-hibbard)
- [SitePoint Forums](https://www.sitepoint.com/community)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jchibbard)

## Website

This site uses the awesome [Hydeout theme](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) which updates the original Hyde theme for Jekyll 4.x and adds new functionality.

The [blog is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/jameshibbard/blog) and deployed to my server with love by [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/).
