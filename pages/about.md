Hi, I'm Jim, a web developer living in the sunny north of Germany.

![James Hibbard](https://hibbard.eu/jim.jpg)

Currently I work for SitePoint as editor of their [JavaScript channel](https://www.sitepoint.com/javascript/). I'm also curator of their back-end newsletter (you can [check out a sample here](http://go.sitepoint.com/t/y-6A4632618792273C) or [sign up here](https://www.sitepoint.com/newsletter/)), as well as technical editor of the occasional book (such as [this one](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/books/javascript-novice-to-ninja-2nd-edition)).

I also work for the local university as a network admin / web dev where I spend a fair bit of my time working on Rails apps.

Here are some of the places you can find me online:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/jameshibbard)
- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1136887/james-hibbard)
- [SitePoint Forums](https://www.sitepoint.com/community/u/Pullo)
- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jchibbard)

## Website

This site uses the awesome [Hydeout theme](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout) which updates the original Hyde theme for Jekyll 3.x and adds new functionality.

The [blog is hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/jameshibbard/blog) and deployed to my server with love by [DeployHQ](https://www.deployhq.com/).
